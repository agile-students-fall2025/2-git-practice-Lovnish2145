[12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/)

I find the "12-Factor App" principles interesting because they outline clear, modern guidelines for building scalable and maintainable applications.  
I especially like the ideas about separating config from code, using stateless processes, and treating backing services as attached resources.  
These practices make applications easier to deploy, debug, and scale in cloud environments.

I think what is outlined in the 12-Factor App principles are very relevant methodologies and best practices for building modern web applications. And interestingly, I believe that these principles will remain relevant for the forseeable future, even with the rapid shifts in technology and AI advancements.
