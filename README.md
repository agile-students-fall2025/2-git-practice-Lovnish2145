[12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/)

I find the "12-Factor App" principles interesting because they outline clear, modern guidelines for building scalable and maintainable applications.  
I especially like the ideas about separating config from code, using stateless processes, and treating backing services as attached resources.  
These practices make applications easier to deploy, debug, and scale in cloud environments.
